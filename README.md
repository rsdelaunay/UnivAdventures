## Introduction

This repository contains a diverse set of projects that I developed as part of my coursework at Iscte - Instituto Universit치rio de Lisboa. The projects cover various aspects of computer science, including algorithm development, data structures, web development, scripting, and systems programming.

## Languages Used

The projects in this repository are written in the following programming languages:

- **Java**: Object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms.
- **C**: Systems programming, low-level operations, and performance optimization.
- **Shell**: Scripting for automation, task management, and system administration.
- **HTML**: Web development, basic frontend design, and structuring of web content.
- **Python**: Scripting, data analysis, and rapid prototyping.

## Projects

Here is a brief overview of the types of projects included:

- **Java Projects**: [Java](./Java)
  - Projects focused on object-oriented programming, including a variety of data structures, algorithms, and design patterns.
  
- **C Projects**: [C](./C)
  - Low-level programming assignments, such as memory management, file handling, and performance-critical applications.
  
- **Shell Scripts**: [Shell](./Shell)
  - A collection of shell scripts designed for automating repetitive tasks, managing files, and performing system administration tasks.
  
- **HTML Projects**: [HTML](./HTML)
  - Basic web development projects, including static webpages, form handling, and user interface design.
  
- **Python Projects**: [Python](./Python)
  - Python scripts for data analysis, automation, and implementing algorithms in a more flexible and readable way.

Each project folder contains a `README.md` file with specific details about the project, including the problem it solves, the tools used, and instructions for running the code.
