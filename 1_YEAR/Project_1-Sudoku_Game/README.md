# UnivAdventures - First Year - Project 1 - Sudoku Game

The objective of this project is to develop the classic game of "Sudoku" in Java, demonstrating its execution in the PandionJ environment. The project utilizes the provided Color and ColorImage classes. To achieve this, the following three classes have been developed:

    SudokuAux (Static Class): This class contains utility functions and procedures for creating and manipulating Sudoku boards, as well as displaying them as images.

    SudokuBoard (Object Class): This class manages the game logic and state of the Sudoku board.

    Sudoku (Object Class): This class handles the overall management of the game, including loading and saving game files.

Implementation Details

The solution leverages the ColorImage, ImageUtil, and Color classes provided during practical lessons, along with Java's String class. The use of any other classes is not permitted, ensuring the project adheres to the constraints provided.
